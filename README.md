# Hello, I'm Logan Munoz! (He/Him) :wave:

I'm a student at Seattle Pacific University (although I disagree with their discriminatory hiring policies) double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I have a passion for problem solving and love learning new things no matter the subject matter. I am currently working on my senior project, Envision, and am looking forward to returning to F5 Inc. after graduation as a Software Engineer I. Feel free to check out the repositories below to see some projects I have worked on, use the following link to view my LinkedIn and learn a bit more about me, and view a pdf of my resume in the corresponding repository. If you wish to get in contact with me you can use the email in my bio. I hope you have a great day!
