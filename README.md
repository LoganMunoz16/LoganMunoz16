# Hello, I'm Logan Munoz! (He/Him) :wave:

I'm a student at Seattle Pacific University (although I disagree with their discriminatory hiring policies) double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, graduating this June 2023. I have a passion for problem solving and love learning new things no matter the subject matter. I am currently working on my senior project, Envision, and am looking forward to returning to F5 Inc. after graduation as a Software Engineer I.

  I interned in the Greenhouse department of the Office of the CTO, working on Project NSure. NSure is a web application designed to reduce NGINX configuration complexity to make it more marketable to small or medium sized businesses. I had the honor of working on a global team with members from the US, India, and Germany, and doing many presentations for this team and the company at large about our progress throughout the internship.
