  <h3>- Brief Description -</h3>
  Professors at our school often struggle to get information regarding internship opportunities or campus events to students over the usual mediums of Teams and email. Envision seeks to find a solution to this by creating a web application allowing professors to drag and drop images that will be displayed cyclically on monitors around the building.
    <br/>
  <br/>
  I am working on a team of 5 for this project, and am handing most of the backend API operations. This has been a tremendous learning experience to discover how to work with a team in a series of sprints to facilitate the development of a full-scale project.
    <br/>
  <br/>
  The MVP for this product is now complete, but it may still be developed by future students and potentially implemented at Seattle Pacific University. As such, we have decided to keep the codebase private until we can confirm that making it public will not lead to any security risks. That being said, the following is a word document containing our team's documentation of the product. This gives a full view into how Envision was made, and the different technologies used to make it without releasing the codebase publicly.

  <h3>- Brief Description -</h3>
  I interned at F5 Inc. in the Greenhouse department of the Office of the CTO, working on Project NSure. NSure is a web application designed to reduce NGINX configuration complexity to make it more marketable to small or medium sized businesses. I had the honor of working on a global team with members from the US, India, and Germany, and doing many presentations for this team and the company at large about our progress throughout the internship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  Below is a calendar created by my intern cohort detailing our activities throughout the internship, created in preparation for our final demo of Project NSure.

  <h3>- Brief Description -</h3>
  This project was completed by myself and my partner <a href="https://github.com/Alison003">Alison Langer</a> as the final for Algorithms Design and Analysis. Given a text file containing a course list, our program will use C++ Boost's graph libraries to create a possible course flow based on credit limits and a starting quarter. I designed the primary algorithm to create this course flow, and Alison handled all the visualizations using libraries such as graphviz.
    <br/>
  <br/>
  Below is a picture of an example course flow that can be created with our program. The linked repository has a very in-depth description of the project, along with some more images and an animation of the visuals being created.

  <h3>- Timeline -</h3>

  <h3>- Course -</h3>
  CSC 3310
  
  
  <h3>- Technologies -</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Golang</li>
    <li>Basic Lexer and Parser Concepts</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>- Brief Description -</h3>
  This parser was created for my Concepts in Programming Langauges course. The program runs a lexical and syntactical analysis on a mock lanaguge called Three Point. If the input program passes all tests, then the code can be re-printed either in Scheme or Prolog syntax. This was a difficult project because I had no exposure to Golang prior to beginning coding, so I had to learn how to build a full parser while also learning Golang.
     <br/>
  <br/>  
  Below is the grammar used for Three Point. 
     <br/>
  <br/>
  
```
START      --> STMT_LIST
STMT_LIST  --> STMT. |
               STMT; STMT_LIST
STMT       --> POINT_DEF |
               TEST
POINT_DEF  --> ID = point(NUM, NUM)
TEST       --> test(OPTION, POINT_LIST)
ID         --> LETTER+
NUM        --> DIGIT+
OPTION     --> triangle |
               square
POINT_LIST --> ID |
               ID, POINT_LIST
LETTER     --> a | b | c | d | e | f | g | ... | z
DIGIT      --> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | ... | 9
```

<h2>Huffman Tree Encoding - Solo</h2>

  <h3>- Timeline -</h3>

  CSC 2431
  
  
  <h3>- Technologies -</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>Huffman Tree Data Structure</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>- Brief Description -</h3>
  This program was created as a final for my Data Structures II course. Given an input text document, the program will create a huffman tree based on how often each character in the document is used. Each character will be assigned a unique combination of 0's and 1's, and then replaced in the original document to create an encoded document. 
     <br/>
  <br/>
  The following is an example of what the huffman encoding will look like. The "CR" character is representative of a newline character.
     <br/>
  <br/>
  
```
{key:   , code: 11}
{key:  a, code: 010}
{key:  e, code: 0010}
{key:  o, code: 0110}
{key:  u, code: 0111}
{key:  r, code: 1000}
{key:  n, code: 1010}
{key:  i, code: 1011}
{key:  l, code: 00001}
{key:  s, code: 00010}
{key:  d, code: 00110}
{key:  m, code: 10011}
{key:  p, code: 000000}
{key:  c, code: 000001}
{key: CR, code: 000110}
{key:  t, code: 000111}
{key:  g, code: 001111}
{key:  q, code: 100100}
{key:  b, code: 100101}
{key:  h, code: 0011100}
{key:  f, code: 00111010}
{key:  z, code: 00111011}

  <h3>- Brief Description -</h3>
  This project was the final for my Netcentric Computing course. This web application is a mock library, allowing a user to add, remove, and edit information on books and their corresponding authors. This was my first step into working with web applications, and creating my own API from scratch to handle database interactions. The back end is kept private for security concerns, but listed in this repository is the code for the front end.
     <br/>
  <br/>  
  Below is a screenshot of what the book list looks like on the website. Feel free to check out the repository for more screenshots and information.

    <li>Basic GUI Principles</li>
    <li>Basic Project Management Principles</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <h3>- Brief Description -</h3>
  This project was created with a team of 5 to enter a Microsoft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus">Hunt the Wumpus</a> competition. We were tasked with making our own rendition of the game Hunt the Wumpus, and then having it judged by a panel of industry professionals on Microsoft's campus. I worked primarily with creating the GUI, although I did assist with debugging some of the other portions of our code. 
     <br/>
  <br/>  
  This was the first major coding project that I took part in, and was a primary reason why I wanted to continue to learn about Computer Science in college. The following picture is of our Kanban Board after having completed our project. This was also a fantastic introduction to that style of development, which was very helpful in organizing our tasks.
